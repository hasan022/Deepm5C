identifying human RNA N5-methylcytosine sites 

File Description
1.	data the ‘data’ file contains all datasets used in this work, including training set and independent set RNA m5C. 
In each sub file, ‘>pos’ indicates that the following sequence is positive sample, whereas ‘>negative’ indicates that the following sequence is negative sample.

2.	EnCode The ‘featureCode’ file contains all codes for feature extraction. For running these codes, python version 3 is required.
3.	model the ‘model’ file contains codes for training model top 8 models, (model1.ipynb, model2.ipynb, …., model8.ipynb). And final model is modelF.ipynb.
